This is a code kata (a customised list of the best Football players of my generation as the Barcelona team) 
to learn Android programming and its eco-system.

This kata has been inspired by a Udemy course called ["How to Make a Freaking Android App"](https://www.udemy.com/how-to-make-a-freaking-android-app/)
